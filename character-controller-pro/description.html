        <p>Character Controller Pro is a 2D/3D Dynamic Capsule based character controller/system.</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>The character controller allows you to handle the movement, rotation and size of your character (among other things) in a precise way.</li>
            <li>The character system (also called "implementation") is built on top of the character controller. It main purpose is to give you some nice and extensible components (character states and abilities, input detection, AI, etc.) allowing you to quickly create your gameplay elements, without reinventing everything from the ground up.</li>
        </ul>
         
        <p>
            The character controller works with both 2D and 3D physics, so you will get an "all in one" package. This is great if you want to create characters for your 2D and/or 3D projects, using one unified asset (otherwise you will probably have to buy two different assets with no connection between them whatsoever).
