        <p>This section serves as a way for me to inform you about the current development state of some new features and bugs fixes. </p>

        <p>A feature can be in one of the following three "levels" of development:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">In mind</span>: Features that would be great to integrate into the asset.</li>
            <li><span style="color: rgb(190, 130, 0);">In Development</span>: The feature is in development (this doesn't mean that the feature will be ready).</li>
            <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Ready</span>: It's done! this is going to the next release.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Features</h2>

            <h3>In mind</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of the character "vision", this can help a lot with specific gameplay mechanics where the camera should behave in one particular way. This 
                    feature will be really helpful in combination with camera assets.
                </li>
                <li>Support for dynamic platforms while being "not grounded" (think of a character hanging from a moving/rotating platform).</li>    
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3>In Development</h3>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>Playable-based animation system, supporting both individual clips and animator controllers for each state.</li>
                <li>Ground Alignment for the graphics object.</li>
                <li>Unity's ("new") Input system as the default input handler. This means this system will be a requirement (you'll need to download the package from the package manager). However, the old 
                    system will be still supported (using a custom input handler).
                </li>
            
            </ul>
                       
            
            <h3>Ready</h3>    
            
            <ul>   
            
            </ul>
